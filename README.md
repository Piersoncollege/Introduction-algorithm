## Welcome to Algortime101 

We are using this [online editor](http://www.informatica-actief.nl/js/tekenapp2/WebLogoGWT.html) to build our algoritms. Please pay close attention to the winner criteria. 

The solution needs to be as efficient as possible and rely on functions.

The [API documentation for the editor can be found here.](https://github.com/Piersoncollege/algorithm101/wiki/%22API%22)
